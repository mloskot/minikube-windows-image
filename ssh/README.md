# SSH Keys

Pair of default [public and private SSH keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement)
to deploy to VM image and to use to authenticate clients with OpenSSH server running on VM.

> [!NOTE]
> Since both of the keys, public and private, are stored in the public repository,
> do NOT use them for authenticating any SSH sessions that are meant to be secure.
